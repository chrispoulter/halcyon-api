## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Halcyon API
  [https://github.com/chrispoulter/halcyon-dotnet](https://github.com/chrispoulter/halcyon-dotnet)

### Install dependencies

Install NPM packages:

```
npm install
```

### Configure environment variables

For local development, you'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project to define the environment variables. This file is ignored by Git, so the secrets will not be committed to the repository.

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5257
```

### Running the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to see the project running.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized build in the `dist` folder.

## Linting & Formatting

To lint and format the code:

```
npm run lint
npm run format
```
